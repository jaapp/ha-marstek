# Marstek Local API for Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration that talks directly to Marstek Venus C/D/E batteries over the official Local API. It delivers local-only telemetry, mode control, and fleet-wide aggregation without relying on the Marstek cloud.

---

## 1. Enable the Local API

1. Make sure your batteries are on the latest firmware.
2. Use the [Marstek Venus Monitor](https://rweijnen.github.io/marstek-venus-monitor/latest/) tool to enable *Local API / Open API* on each device.
3. Note the UDP port (default `30000`) and confirm the devices respond on your LAN.

## 2. Install the Integration

### Via HACS
1. Click this button:

[![Open this repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jaapp&repository=ha-marstek-local-api&category=integration)

Or:
1. Open **HACS → Integrations → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/jaapp/ha-marstek-local-api` as an *Integration*.
3. Install **Marstek Local API** and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual copy
1. Drop `custom_components/marstek_local_api` into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## 3. Add Devices

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **Marstek Local API**.
2. The discovery step lists every battery it finds on your network. Select one device or pick **All devices** to build a single multi-battery entry.
3. If discovery misses a unit, choose **Manual IP entry** and provide the host/port you noted earlier.

After setup you can return to **Settings → Devices & Services → Marstek Local API → Configure** to:
- Rename devices, adjust the polling interval, or add/remove batteries to the existing multi-device entry.
- Trigger discovery again when new batteries join the network.

> **Important:** If you want all batteries to live under the same config entry (and keep the virtual **Marstek System** device), use the integration’s **Configure** button to add/remove batteries. The default Home Assistant “Add Device” button creates a brand-new config entry and a separate virtual system device.

## 4. Single Entry vs. Virtual System Battery

- **Single-device entry**: created when you add an individual battery. Each entry exposes the battery’s entities and optional operating-mode controls.
- **Multi-device entry**: created when you pick *All devices* or add more batteries through the options flow. The integration keeps one config entry containing all members and exposes a synthetic device called **“Marstek System”**.  
  - The “system” device aggregates fleet metrics (total capacity, total grid import/export, combined state, etc.).  
  - Every physical battery still appears as its own device with per-pack entities.

## 6. Services

| Service | Description | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `marstek_local_api.request_data_sync` | Triggers an immediate poll of every configured coordinator. | Optional `entry_id` to refresh a specific config entry. |

You can call the service from **Developer Tools → Services** when you need an on-demand refresh after physical changes or troubleshooting.

## 7. Tips & Troubleshooting

- Keep the standard polling interval (60 s) unless you have explicit reasons to slow it down. Faster intervals than 60s can lead to the battery becoming unresponsive.
- If discovery fails, double-check that the Local API remains enabled after firmware upgrades and that UDP port `30000` is accessible from Home Assistant.
- For verbose logging, append the following to `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.marstek_local_api: debug
  ```

## API maturity & known issues

Note: the Marstek Local API is still relatively new and evolving. Behavior can vary between hardware revisions (v2/v3) and firmware versions (EMS and BMS). When reporting issues, always include diagnostic data (logs and the integration's diagnostic fields).

Known issues (brief):
- Polling too often might cause connection to be lost to the CT002/3
- Battery temperature may read 10× too high on older BMS versions.
- API call timeouts (shown as warnings in the log).
- Some API calls are not supported on older firmware — please ensure devices are updated before filing issues.
- Polling faster than 60s is not advised; devices have been reported to become unstable (e.g. losing CT003 connection).
 - Energy counters / capacity fields may be reported in Wh instead of kWh on certain firmware (values appear 1000× off).
 - `ES.GetStatus` can be unresponsive on some Venus E v3 firmwares (reported on v137 / v139).
 - CT connection state may be reported as "disconnected" / power values might not be updated even when a CT is connected (appears fixed in HW v2 firmware v154+).

Most of these issues are resolved by updating the device to the latest firmware — Marstek staggers rollouts, so many systems still run older versions. The Local API is evolving quickly and should stabilise as updates are deployed.

Example warnings:

```
2025-10-21 10:01:34.986 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.marstek_local_api.api] Command ES.GetStatus timed out after 15s (attempt 1/3, host=192.168.0.47)
2025-10-21 10:02:28.693 ERROR (MainThread) [custom_components.marstek_local_api.api] Command EM.GetStatus failed after 3 attempt(s); returning no result
```

Quick note for issue reports (EN): always attach the integration diagnostics export and relevant HA logs when filing a bug — it is required for effective troubleshooting.


### Standalone connectivity test

In the repository you’ll find `test/test_discovery.py`, a small CLI that reuses the integration code to probe connectivity outside Home Assistant:

```bash
cd test
python3 test_discovery.py              # broadcast discovery
python3 test_discovery.py 192.168.7.101  # target a specific battery
```

It discovers all reachable batteries, exercises every Local API method, and highlights network issues before you wire the devices into your HA instance.
