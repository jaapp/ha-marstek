# Marstek Local API for Home Assistant

> **Firmware warning:** Marstek’s Local API firmware is still immature, so most glitches originate in the batteries, not here.
> Report issues to Marstek unless you can clearly trace them to this project.

Home Assistant integration that talks directly to Marstek Venus C/D/E batteries over the official Local API. It delivers local-only telemetry, mode control, and fleet-wide aggregation without relying on the Marstek cloud.

---

## 1. Enable the Local API

1. Make sure your batteries are on the latest firmware.
2. Use the [Marstek Venus Monitor](https://rweijnen.github.io/marstek-venus-monitor/latest/) tool to enable *Local API / Open API* on each device.
3. Note the UDP port (default `30000`) and confirm the devices respond on your LAN.

## 2. Install the Integration

### Via HACS
1. Click this button:

[![Open this repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jaapp&repository=ha-marstek-local-api&category=integration)

Or:
1. Open **HACS → Integrations → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/jaapp/ha-marstek-local-api` as an *Integration*.
3. Install **Marstek Local API** and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual copy
1. Drop `custom_components/marstek_local_api` into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## 3. Add Devices

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **Marstek Local API**.
2. The discovery step lists every battery it finds on your network. Select one device or pick **All devices** to build a single multi-battery entry.
3. If discovery misses a unit, choose **Manual IP entry** and provide the host/port you noted earlier.

After setup you can return to **Settings → Devices & Services → Marstek Local API → Configure** to:
- Rename devices, adjust the polling interval, or add/remove batteries to the existing multi-device entry.
- Trigger discovery again when new batteries join the network.

> **Important:** If you want all batteries to live under the same config entry (and keep the virtual **Marstek System** device), use the integration’s **Configure** button to add/remove batteries. The default Home Assistant “Add Device” button creates a brand-new config entry and a separate virtual system device.

## 4. Single Entry vs. Virtual System Battery

- **Single-device entry**: created when you add an individual battery. Each entry exposes the battery’s entities and optional operating-mode controls.
- **Multi-device entry**: created when you pick *All devices* or add more batteries through the options flow. The integration keeps one config entry containing all members and exposes a synthetic device called **“Marstek System”**.  
  - The “system” device aggregates fleet metrics (total capacity, total grid import/export, combined state, etc.).  
  - Every physical battery still appears as its own device with per-pack entities.

Every sensor listed above also exists in an aggregated form under the **Marstek System** device whenever you manage multiple batteries together (prefixed with `system_`).

### Mode Control Buttons

Each battery exposes three button entities for quick mode switching:

- `button.marstek_auto_mode` - Switch to Auto mode
- `button.marstek_ai_mode` - Switch to AI mode
- `button.marstek_manual_mode` - Switch to Manual mode

The `sensor.marstek_operating_mode` displays the current active mode (Auto, AI, Manual, or Passive). **Passive mode** requires parameters (power and duration) and can only be activated via the `set_passive_mode` service (see Services section below).

## 6. Services

### Data Synchronization

| Service | Description | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `marstek_local_api.request_data_sync` | Triggers an immediate poll of every configured coordinator. | Optional `entry_id` (specific config entry) and/or `device_id` (single battery). |

### Manual Mode Scheduling

The integration provides three services for configuring manual mode schedules. Manual mode allows you to define up to 10 time-based schedules that control when the battery charges/discharges and at what power level.

> Select the **battery device** for all schedule services. The integration resolves the correct manual mode button automatically.

> **Note:** The Marstek Local API does not support reading schedule configurations back from the device. Schedules are write-only, so the integration cannot display currently configured schedules.

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `marstek_local_api.set_manual_schedule` | Configure a single schedule slot (0-9) with time, days, and power settings. |
| `marstek_local_api.set_manual_schedules` | Configure multiple schedule slots at once using YAML. |
| `marstek_local_api.clear_manual_schedules` | Disable all 10 schedule slots. |

#### Setting a Single Schedule

Configure one schedule slot at a time through the Home Assistant UI:

```yaml
service: marstek_local_api.set_manual_schedule
data:
  device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
  time_num: 0  # Slot 0-9
  start_time: "08:00"
  end_time: "16:00"
  days:
    - mon
    - tue
    - wed
    - thu
    - fri
  power: -2000  # Negative = charge limit (2000W), positive = discharge limit
  enabled: true
```

#### Setting Multiple Schedules

Configure several slots at once using YAML mode in Developer Tools → Services:

```yaml
service: marstek_local_api.set_manual_schedules
data:
  device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
  schedules:
    - time_num: 0
      start_time: "08:00"
      end_time: "16:00"
      days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
      power: -2000  # Charge at max 2000W
      enabled: true
    - time_num: 1
      start_time: "18:00"
      end_time: "22:00"
      days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
      power: 800  # Discharge at max 800W
      enabled: true
```

#### Clearing All Schedules

Remove all configured schedules by disabling all 10 slots:

```yaml
service: marstek_local_api.clear_manual_schedules
data:
  device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
```

#### Schedule Parameters

- **time_num**: Schedule slot number (0-9). Each slot is independent.
- **start_time** / **end_time**: 24-hour format (HH:MM). Schedules can span midnight.
- **days**: List of weekdays (`mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`). Defaults to all days.
- **power**: Power limit in watts. **Important:** Use negative values for charging (e.g., `-2000` = 2000W charge limit) and positive values for discharging (e.g., `800` = 800W discharge limit). Use `0` for no limit.
- **enabled**: Whether this schedule is active (default: `true`).
- **device_id**: Home Assistant device ID of the target battery (required).

#### Important Notes

- Changing the operating mode to Manual via the button entity will **not** activate any schedules automatically. You must configure schedules using the services above.
- Multiple schedules can overlap. The device handles priority internally.
- Schedule configurations are stored on the device and persist across reboots.
- Since schedule reading is not supported, keep a copy of your schedule configuration in Home Assistant automations or scripts.

You can call these services from **Developer Tools → Services** or use them in automations and scripts.

### Passive Mode Control

The `marstek_local_api.set_passive_mode` service enables **Passive mode** for direct power control. Passive mode allows you to charge or discharge the selected battery at a specific power level for a defined duration.

**Important:** Power values use signed integers:
- **Negative values** = Charging (e.g., `-2000` means charge at 2000W)
- **Positive values** = Discharging (e.g., `1500` means discharge at 1500W)

#### Service Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `device_id` | Yes | string | - | Battery to control. The integration resolves the operating mode sensor automatically. |
| `power` | Yes | integer | -10000 to 10000 | Power in watts (negative = charge, positive = discharge) |
| `duration` | Yes | integer | 1 to 86400 | Duration in seconds (max 24 hours) |

#### Examples

**Charge at 2000W for 1 hour:**
```yaml
service: marstek_local_api.set_passive_mode
data:
  device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
  power: -2000  # Negative = charging
  duration: 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
```

**Discharge at 1500W for 30 minutes:**
```yaml
service: marstek_local_api.set_passive_mode
data:
  device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
  power: 1500  # Positive = discharging
  duration: 1800  # 30 minutes in seconds
```

**Use in an automation (charge during cheap electricity hours):**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Charge battery during off-peak hours"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "02:00:00"
    action:
      - service: marstek_local_api.set_passive_mode
        data:
          device_id: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          power: -3000  # Charge at 3000W
          duration: 14400  # 4 hours
```

## 7. Tips & Troubleshooting

- Keep the standard polling interval (60 s) unless you have explicit reasons to slow it down. Faster intervals than 60s can lead to the battery becoming unresponsive.
- If discovery fails, double-check that the Local API remains enabled after firmware upgrades and that UDP port `30000` is accessible from Home Assistant.
- For verbose logging, append the following to `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.marstek_local_api: debug
  ```

## API maturity & known issues

Note: the Marstek Local API is still relatively new and evolving. Behavior can vary between hardware revisions (v2/v3) and firmware versions (EMS and BMS). When reporting issues, always include diagnostic data (logs and the integration's diagnostic fields).

Known issues:
- Polling too often might cause connection to be lost to the CT002/3
- Battery temperature may read 10× too high on older BMS versions.
- API call timeouts (shown as warnings in the log).
- Some API calls are not supported on older firmware — please ensure devices are updated before filing issues.
- Manual mode requests must include a schedule: the API rejects `ES.SetMode` without `manual_cfg`, and because schedules are write-only the integration always sends a disabled placeholder in slot 9. Reapply your own slot 9 schedule after toggling Manual mode if needed.
- Polling faster than 60s is not advised; devices have been reported to become unstable (e.g. losing CT003 connection).
 - Energy counters / capacity fields may be reported in Wh instead of kWh on certain firmware (values appear 1000× off).
 - `ES.GetStatus` can be unresponsive on some Venus E v3 firmwares (reported on v137 / v139).
 - CT connection state may be reported as "disconnected" / power values might not be updated even when a CT is connected (appears fixed in HW v2 firmware v154+).

Most of these issues are resolved by updating the device to the latest firmware — Marstek staggers rollouts, so many systems still run older versions. The Local API is evolving quickly and should stabilise as updates are deployed.

Example warnings:

```
2025-10-21 10:01:34.986 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.marstek_local_api.api] Command ES.GetStatus timed out after 15s (attempt 1/3, host=192.168.0.47)
2025-10-21 10:02:28.693 ERROR (MainThread) [custom_components.marstek_local_api.api] Command EM.GetStatus failed after 3 attempt(s); returning no result
```

Quick note for issue reports (EN): always attach the integration diagnostics export and relevant HA logs when filing a bug — it is required for effective troubleshooting.


### Standalone device tool

In the repository you'll find `test/test_tool.py`, a CLI that reuses the integration code to diagnose and control batteries outside Home Assistant:

```bash
cd test
python3 test_tool.py discover                       # discover and print diagnostics
python3 test_tool.py discover --ip 192.168.7.101    # target a specific IP
python3 test_tool.py set-test-schedules             # apply test schedules
python3 test_tool.py clear-schedules                # clear manual schedules
python3 test_tool.py set-passive --power -2000 --duration 3600
python3 test_tool.py set-mode auto --ip 192.168.7.101
```

The default `discover` command runs the full diagnostic suite. Additional subcommands allow you to verify manual scheduling, passive mode, and operating mode changes without installing Home Assistant.
